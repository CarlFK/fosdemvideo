Howto setup a video infrastructure
----------------------------------

1. prepare in svn
2. boot from usbstick
3. profit!

Now these three little steps again, but in detail:


preparing the fai setup
-----------------------
svn co svn+ssh://$USERNAME@svn.debian.org/svn/debconf-video/fai-config/
cd fai-config

cd class
# take a look at an existing conference to learn how fai works 
view 29-fosdem2009-classes
view FOSDEM.var
view patty.var

cp 29-fosdem2009-classes   29-yourconf-classes
cp FOSDEM.var	YOURCONF.var
cp patty.var	a_hostname.var

vi 29-yourconf-classes 	
vi YOURCONF.var		# FOSDEM.var sets "EVENT=fosdem09" - you need 
			# 	to set this to the name of the directory 
			#	you create in the debconf-video package 
			#	- see below
# do hostname.var's later, they are mostly cosmetic to make FAI not display some warnings

# optional step:
#   take a look what software is installed in which class. ../class/29-yourconf-classes definis the classes the host is in
cd ../package_config
view *

# also optional step:
cd ../scripts
# each class also has scripts associated with them

# there are two more directories: debconf/ and files/. The former has 
# class based debconf preseeding files and the second files which can
# be copied with the fcopy command from fai. grep in the scripts dir
# for "fcopy" and then look at that script and the corresponding 
# _directory_ with class files in files/


initial install
---------------
# create an usbstick as described in ./src/create_usbstick_howto.txt 
# boot from usbstick, choose the right hostname per machine as set in ./class/29-yourconf-classes


doing changes later / debug installations
-----------------------------------------
run "softupdate" as root to update the configuration (this is basically a around "/usr/sbin/fai -N softupdate")
/var/log/fai/$hostname/last/FAI_CLASSES lists the classes a host is in
/var/log/fai/$hostname/last/ is generally useful to look at


Second configuration area
-------------------------

Sadly not all configuration is in FAIs config space, some is in the debconf-video package. (This is a todo item for DebConf9 or better, for before DebConf9.) FAI is used/useful there too, as it takes care of putting the (once) manually entered video passwds into the right config files.

Preparing the package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
svn co svn+ssh://i$USERNAME@svn.debian.org/svn/debconf-video/package/trunk
# you can also work in branches like pycon does :)
# there is a doc/README too, read it.

Create a directory inside the conf/ directory named after your conference. This needs to match EVENT defined in $fai-config-dir/classes/YOURCONF.var
Base it on an existing conf.

Then build as usual with svn-buildpackage.

Uploading the package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Then you need to upload the package to the debconf-apt-repository. Choose "lenny" as distribution.

This is the relevant section from my ~/.dupload.conf:

$cfg{'dc'} = {
        fqdn => "cmburns.debconf.org",
        incoming => "/var/www/db/dc-admin/archive/mini-dinstall/incoming/",
        # files pass on to dinstall on ftp-master which sends emails itself
        method => "scpb",
        login => "holger",
};



Put the passwords on each machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
edit /etc/default/debconf-video.passwd on each machine once, then run softupdate. the fai configuration will put the values in the right files.

### begin /etc/default/debconf-video.passwd example:
export ICECAST_PASS=fubar
### end

DATABASE_PASSWORD needs to be set the same way on the host of the PENTA class, currently thats barney. Ben and Holger know the password.

Run softupdate once again. Voila, it's time for some cake now :-)
