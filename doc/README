preparing the fai setup
-----------------------
svn co svn+ssh://$USERNAME@svn.debian.org/svn/debconf-video/fai-config/
cd fai-config

cd class
# take a look at an existing conference to learn how fai works 
view 29-fosdem2009-classes
view FOSDEM.var
view patty.var

cp 29-fosdem2009-classes   29-yourconf-classes
cp FOSDEM.var	YOURCONF.var
cp patty.var	a_hostname.var

vi 29-yourconf-classes
vi YOURCONF.var
# do hostname.var's later

# optional step:
#   take a look what software is installed in which class. ../class/29-yourconf-classes definis the classes the host is in
cd ../package_config
view *

# also optional step:
cd ../scripts
# each class also has scripts associated with them

initial install
---------------
# create an usbstick as described in ./src/create_usbstick_howto.txt 
# boot from usbstick, choose the right hostname per machine as set in ./class/29-yourconf-classes

doing changes later / debug installations
-----------------------------------------
run "softupdate" as root to update the configuration (this is basically a around "/usr/sbin/fai -N softupdate")
/var/log/fai/$hostname/last/FAI_CLASSES lists the classes a host is in
/var/log/fai/$hostname/last/ is generally useful to look at


Second configuration area
-------------------------

Sadly not all configuration is in FAIs config space, some is in the debconf-video package. FAI is used/useful there too, as it takes
care of putting the (once) manually entered video passwds into the right config files.

uploading packages to $url.debconf.org

edit /etc/default/debconf-video.passwd on each machine once, then run softupdate. the fai configuration will put the values in the right files.
