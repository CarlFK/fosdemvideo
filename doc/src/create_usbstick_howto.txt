umount /dev/sdb1
syslinux /dev/sdb1		# the t60 needs 3.51 from sid/holgers etch backports...
install-mbr /dev/sdb


usage notes
-----------
Upon boot you will be greated with:

MBR FA:

Then just press the "a" key and the prompt will change to:

MBR 1234F

Then press the "1" key and the system should boot into the text-based installer.


The installation is automatic, the root password will be set to "fai". You just
have to confirm partitioning and choose a hostname from the following list:

h01ger's: 	patty
DaCa's:		daffy
Q_'s		selma

That should be all ;)
