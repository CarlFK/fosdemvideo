-----------------------------

fdisk /dev/sdb
-> create a WIN32 VFAT partition (type b in fdisk)

mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

copy the following files to /mnt:

vmlinuz				# see current directory (taken from http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/ )
initrd.gz   			# see current directory (taken from from http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/ )
syslinux.cfg   			# see current directory :) defines language and preseed file url
debian-40r0-i386-businesscard.iso	# take it from http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/4.0_r6/i386/iso-cd/ !
preseed.cfg  			# see current directory
final_setup.sh  		# see current directory
ac583520.asc			# h01gers public key

umount /dev/sdb1
syslinux /dev/sdb1		# the t60 needs 3.51 from sid/holgers etch backports...
install-mbr /dev/sdb


usage notes
-----------
Upon boot you will be greated with:

MBR FA:

Then just press the "a" key and the prompt will change to:

MBR 1234F

Then press the "1" key and the system should boot into the text-based installer.


The installation is automatic, the root password will be set to "fai". You just
(*) have to confirm partitioning and choose a hostname from the following list:

h01ger's: 	patty
DaCa's:		daffy
Q_'s		selma

That should be all ;)

After the installation is done, check /etc/motd and /etc/hosts if they look
somewhat sensible for this ;-)


(*) sadly there is a bug, so you need to choose a country too :)
