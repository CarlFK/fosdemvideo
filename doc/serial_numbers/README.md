This directory contains serial numbers on the equipment we have, for insurance purposes.

As far as values go:

- Current value of a twinpact is about €150 (average price it fetches on
  eBay, they're EOL as far as new hardware goes though)
- Laptops: need to check
- Servers: need to check
- Cameras: various, need to check. We won't have serial numbers for
  these before thursday though, so I'm not sure it matters.
- hard disks: brand new, €75 apiece
