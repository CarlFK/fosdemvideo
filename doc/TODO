todo for usbsticks
------------------
(not needed for .ar anymore)

- test if hostname is really asked as it should
-- maybe do that fully automatic in .ar? (by relying on dhcp)
- change to use debconfs apt repo not holgers
- huh? test if apt key really is fetched via http
- in .ar: ask for root-pw?! set one and mail it

todo for dc9
