open questions
----
* tripods ordered?
  - Cameras all come with tripods
* backup laptops ordered? /me suggests 2 at least, so we can cope with 5% failures..
  - I've ordered 45 laptops now.
* wheezy + which dvswitch version?
  - debconf + bugfix for manual fade state machine failure?

3 servers
----
* how do we use them?
  - 7 or 8 rooms per server. TODO: decide which rooms on which server (not too urgent).
  
    Might be an issue connecting to AW; need to talk to network team.

penta integration
----
* smells trouble

15 twinpacts
----
* 2 from IRILL
* 3 from FOSDEM
* 10 from carl (2 need power supplies fixed)
* 4 from Kenny (KDE)
* four from ebay? CarlFK found some, maybe buy those.

That would bring the total to 23...

vga2usb 
----
* some epiphan hw just ordered...
  - Works, but has some limitations; dvsource would need to be restarted
    every time a laptop connects or changes resolution. The "change of
    resolution" seems to include "DPMS power off"...

People (core team)
----
* wouter
* h01ger (arriving 26th or 25th, leaving the 3rd)
