3 servers

* how do we use them?
  - 7 or 8 rooms per server. TODO: decide which rooms on which server (not too urgent).

Planning
========

This is an initial planning for what we'll do during the week before FOSDEM.

- Monday: install servers, configure them, install transcoding scripts,
  monitoring, etc
- Tuesday: install & test laptops
- Wednesday: hook up cameras & twinpacts, test things, divide gear over boxes
- Thursday: go buy stuff if we figure out we're missing something, write
  documentation for volunteers, make waitscreen loop
- Friday: margin in case we run behind schedule
- Saturday/Sunday, early-o-clock: go to ULB and be ready to hand out video gear
  to volunteers
- Saturday/Sunday, 8:00 AM: yell at devrooms who've not shown up yet, go set up
  gear there ourselves (and possibly send volunteers there as well)
